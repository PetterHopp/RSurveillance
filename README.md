RSurveillance
=============

`RSurveillance` provides a range of functions for the design and
    analysis of disease surveillance activities. These functions were
    originally developed for animal health surveillance activities but can be
    equally applied to aquatic animal, wildlife, plant and human health
    surveillance activities. Utilities are included for sample size calculation
    and analysis of representative surveys for disease freedom, risk-based
    studies for disease freedom and for prevalence estimation.

You can track (and contribute to) development of `RSurveillance`
at https://github.com/evansergeant/RSurveillance.

Installation
------------

RSurveillance has not yet been released on CRAN.

To install the development version of RSurveillance, copy the current version of the R Library 
from https://github.com/evansergeant/RSurveillanceLibrary to your local R library.

Usage
-----
`RSurveillance` functions are organised into three broad areas of surveillance, namely representative freedom surveys,
risk-based freedom surveys, probability of freedom estimation and prevalence estimation. Within these areas functions can be further grouped according to purpose (depending on surveillance area/purpose), such as sample size calculation, population sensitivity estimation, prevalence estimation and background functions. Specific functions are summarised below according to these categories.

##Representative freedom surveys

###Risk-based freedom surveys 

###Probability of freedom estimation

###Prevalence estimation
