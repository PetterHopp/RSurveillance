Description: A range of functions for the design and
    analysis of disease surveillance activities. These functions were
    originally developed for animal health surveillance activities but can be
    equally applied to aquatic animal, wildlife, plant and human health
    surveillance activities. Utilities are included for sample size calculation
    and analysis of representative surveys for disease freedom, risk-based
    studies for disease freedom and for prevalence estimation.
